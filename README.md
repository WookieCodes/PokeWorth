# Pok&eacute;Worth
Pok&eacute;Worth is a tool for players of Pok&eacute;mon Go, to use to quickly and easily determine the more efficient way to spend their Pok&eacute;Coins and money.

## How it works
The user selects which items they want to purchase by marking the checkboxes. Based on the currently selected items, calculations are run to compare the average price of buying items individually versus the average price per item in the deal box.

## User interaction

 1. User clicks on the items from the list of checkboxes to trigger calculations.
 2. User clicks on the Pok&eacute;Boxes to shrink and expand the amount of detail shown.
